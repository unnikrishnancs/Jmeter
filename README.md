# Jmeter
Jmeter records server-side response times. There are situations where the server side response times are within SLA but on the UI side the response side SLA are not met. 
So Jmeter has provided a plug-in called Selenium Webdriver sampler that can be used to capture client-side response times. This JMX file shows how this can be achieved 
using a demo application provided by Blazemeter. Hope this helps.
